 There are many other technologies that involve embedding external content
 besides the ones we discussed here. We saw some in earlier articles,
 such as <video>, <audio>, and <img>, but there are others to discover,
 such as <canvas> for JavaScript-generated 2D and 3D graphics,
 and <svg> for embedding vector graphics. We'll look at SVG in the next article of the module.
