			This is optional, but it is advised that you include it.
			The type attribute contains the MIME type of the file specified by the <source>,
			and browsers can use the type to immediately skip videos they don't understand.
			If type isn't included, browsers will load and try to play each file
			until they find one that works, which obviously takes time
			and is an unnecessary use of resources. -->
